# Patatap Clone

##Description:
This is a clone of the beautiful and interactive website (patatap.com). I did this clone by following a code-along/tutorial in a Udemy course called Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele. This app mainly uses two Javascript libraries called PaperJS and HowlerJS. Colt walked us through building the entire application from scratch.

## What I learned: 
I learned how to include external libraries (PaperJS and HowlerJS) and how to read the docs to learn how to do specific things, like draw a scale and scale it down. I also learned how to debug the app. At the end, I had trouble getting it to work. After an hour of debugging, I found the culprit- one unnecessary semicolon. I remember thinking I should post a question on the lecture Q&A to get help but I resisted the urge and finally figured it out on my own. It made me feel more confident in my abilities and less afraid of using external libraries.
